    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of chicken cut into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon tumeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.).</li>
        <li>Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.</li>
    </ol>
